## Overview
EZMealPlan is a CLI-based system that helps users to plan their meals. The app contains a pre-created, customisable
list of meals, which the user can filter by name, ingredients, and cost. Their favourite meals can be added into their 
personal wishlist. The app can also recommend the user a meal to prepare, based on the ingredients that they currently 
own.
